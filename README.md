### What is this repo even?
Well, honestly I just want to learn about GitHub more, so I was thinking what would be a good way
So I made this repo for two reasons, one my scripts are easy to back up somewhere more safe from myself
Second, I change my scripts a lot so it gives a good chance to try all new stuff 

### Why python for linux scripting?
The reason is simple, I do not like bash, and python is also cross-platform
And it was time I finally start to get annoyed by my own choice of using a linter for push
